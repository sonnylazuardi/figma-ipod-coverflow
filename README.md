# Figma iPod CoverFlow

Inspired by these two tweets, [Figma Platformer Engine](https://twitter.com/alyssaxuu/status/1104473813201444865) and [iPod - iPhone App](https://twitter.com/elvin_not_11/status/1199717678908366854), I have an idea to make a classic playlist of my favorite podcast on spotify. So I created the list of podcast in Figma, I can arrange and edit the cover as I want.
